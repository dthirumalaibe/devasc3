# Module 2 - Mastering Network Fundamentals

## Lab files
The `lab/` directory contains two subdirectories. I built the demo topology
using two separate simulators to provide options for learners.
  * `virl`: This directory contains the Cisco VIRL topology file along with
    the standalone text configurations used for VIRL. This is a Cisco product
    but is not free.
  * `gns3`: This directory contains the GNS3 portable project along with
    the standalone text configurations used for VIRL. This is a not Cisco
    product but is free.

For those using another simulation tool, standalone virtual machines, or
physical devices, you can manually edit the GNS3 or VIRL configurations to
suit your specific platform.

## Diagrams
This directory also contains diagrams for the routing and switching
demonstrations from the course. These diagrams provide additional detail,
such as MAC/IP addressing, port numbers, and more. Referencing these
diagrams is not necessary for high-level learning, but those who want to
explore the network in greater detail may want to use them.
