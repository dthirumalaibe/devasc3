# Collection of network devices to be tested. In this example, the three
# routers (R1, R2, and F1) are all running OSPF, a routing protocol, to
# exchange IP routes, which is the focus of this example. Even though these
# devices are IOS, not IOS-XE, some of the Genie parsers for IOS have not
# been fully implemented, but they have for IOS-XE, which generally still
# work on IOS devices. Note that the hostname for each device, such as R1,
# is case sensitive and MUST match the configured hostname of the device.
