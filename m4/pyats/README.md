# Cisco pyATS and Genie Demo
These files are included for reference to give you a minimum
working example of these powerful tools. This was not covered
in the course as these tools are quite complex and certainly not
beginner-level tools.

## Sample runs
In the `data_ref/` directory, there are two files.
  * `passing_run.txt`: This shows an example where all tests pass. This
    implies all OSPF neighbors are up
  * `failing_run.txt`: This shows an example where some tests fail. I
    broke one of the OSPF neighbors on purpose to simulate this failure.
