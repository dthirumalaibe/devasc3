# Module 4 - Introducing Infrastructure as Code
This directory contains subdirectories for all three major
projects in this module.
  * `bash`: Contains demo files for the Bash web server setup
  * `ansible`: Contains demo files for the Ansible web server setup
  * `yang`: Contain demo files for YANG exploration and binding test
  * `pyats`: Contain reference files for Cisco pyATS and Genie framework.
    This was not demonstrated in the course as it is an advanced topic.

## Packages
Be sure to install the required Python packages
following command. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

> This does not include `pyats` or `genie` as these have special
dependencies which are explained in the `pyats/README.md` file.
